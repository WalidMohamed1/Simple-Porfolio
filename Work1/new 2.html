	<h1>Computer Science</h1>
	<p>
	<h3>
	Computer science is the study of the theory, experimentation, and engineering that form the basis for the design and use of<br>
	computers. It is the scientific and practical approach to computation and its applications and the systematic study of the<br>
	feasibility, structure, expression, and mechanization of the methodical procedures (or algorithms) that underlie the acquisition,<br>
	representation,processing, storage, communication of, and access to, information. An alternate, more succinct definition of<br>
	computer science is the study of automating algorithmic processes that scale. A computer scientist specializes in the theory of<br>
	computation and the design of computational systems.

	<h1>Mathematics</h1>
	<p>
	<h3>
	Mathematics is the study of such topics as quantity, structure, space, and change.It has no generally accepted definition.<br>
    Mathematicians seek out patterns and use them to formulate new conjectures. Mathematicians resolve the truth or falsity of<br>
	conjectures by mathematical proof. When mathematical structures are good models of real phenomena, then mathematical<br>
	reasoning can provide insight or predictions about nature. Through the use of abstraction and logic, mathematics developed from<br>
	counting, calculation, measurement, and the systematic study of the shapes and motions of physical objects. Practical mathematics<br>
	has been a human activity from as far back as written records exist. The research required to solve mathematical problems can<br>
	take years or even centuries of sustained inquiry.

	<h1>Statistics</h1>
	<p>
	<h3>
	Statistics is a branch of mathematics dealing with the collection, analysis, interpretation, presentation, and organization of<br>
	data.In applying statistics to, for example, a scientific, industrial, or social problem, it is conventional to begin with a<br>
	statistical population or a statistical model process to be studied. Populations can be diverse topics such as "all people living in a<br>
	country" or "every atom composing a crystal". Statistics deals with all aspects of data including the planning of data collection in<br>
	terms of the design of surveys and experiments.

	<h1>Physics</h1>
	<p>
	<h3>
	Physics is the natural science that studies matter and its motion and behavior through space and time and that studies<br>
	the related entities of energy and force. Physics is one of the most fundamental scientific disciplines, and its main goal is<br>
	to understand how the universe behaves.
