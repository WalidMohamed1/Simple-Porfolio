        My name is Walid Mohamed and I am 20 years old but
        a month .. I am from Egypt
        and study in the Faculty of Science, Ain Shams
        University Department
        of Computer Science in the second level .. I'm looking
        forward to 
        being a good designer . The hobby closest to my heart is
        reading,
        which I spend all my time so I love creativity and imagination so I look for design :) .
