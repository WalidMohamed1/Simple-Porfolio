    <h2>Giza</h2>
    <p>
        Giza is an Egyptian city on the west bank of the Nile, near Cairo.
        The Giza Plateau is home to iconic Egyptian monuments,
        including three tall pyramids built as royal mausoleums around the 26th century B.C. The largest,
        the Great Pyramid, is King Khufu’s tomb. The Great Sphinx is a vast sculpture of a man’s head on a lion’s body.
        The Solar Boat Museum displays a restored cedar barge found buried near the Great Pyramid.
